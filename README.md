# 210-Final-project
Dataset:
I will use the "Largest Companies by Market Cap" dataset from companiesmarketcap.com. This dataset is valuable for examining the financial standings of major global companies, with applications for understanding trends in business growth, market dominance, and financial health. Given my finance major and market analysis experience, this dataset aligns well with my academic and career interests in exploring corporate financial health and market trends.
Problem Statement / Question:
This project aims to analyze the distribution of market caps and stock prices across sectors, focusing on identifying disparities and market leaders. The primary question is: How does market cap and stock price distribution vary across sectors, and what patterns emerge in the global representation of dominant companies?
My insights so far indicate a heavily right-skewed distribution, with the U.S. companies prominently leading in representation and some firms having significantly high market caps and stock prices.
